## Description

The idea for this project came from the Spotify Wrapped, which is a feature that Spotify releases every year that shows you your top artists and tracks from the past year. I wanted to see my tops not only of the past year, but of all time as well. I didn't want to wait until the end of the year to see my tops, so I decided to look into the Spotify API and see if I could make my own version of the Spotify Wrapped. I found out that the Spotify API has a lot of endpoints that can be used to get a lot of information about a user's account, and I decided to use some of these endpoints to get the information I needed to make this project.

## Features

- See your top 12, 24, or 50 tracks of the past 4 weeks, 6 months, or all time
- See your top 12, 24, or 48 artists of the past 4 weeks, 6 months, or all time
- See your recently played tracks
- Representation of your top in cards and tables
- Authentication with Spotify
- Connection to the Spotify API

## Technologies

## Future Plans

There are several features that I would like to add to this project in the future. Some of these features include:

- An improved index and home page
- Add a footer

- Implement a database to store user data
- Get Spotify's extension request approved
